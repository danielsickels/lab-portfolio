# RJ45 Cables and Connectors

## What is RJ45?

RJ45 is the standard connector used for Ethernet cablesâ€”the universal plug for wired Internet connections. Think of it as the "USB plug" for networking.

## Components

**RJ45 Connector (Clear Plastic Plug):**

- 8 metal pins that contact internal cable wires
- Plastic clip for secure locking when plugged in
- Available for different wire types:
  - **Solid wire**: Rigid, ideal for wall installations and long runs
  - **Stranded wire**: Flexible, perfect for short patch cables

## Cable Types Using RJ45

All Ethernet cable categories use RJ45 connectors:

- **Cat5e**: Basic Ethernet (1 Gbps)
- **Cat6**: Enhanced performance (10 Gbps)
- **Cat6a**: Shielded, higher bandwidth
- **Cat7**: Premium shielding and performance
- **Cat8**: Latest standard, highest speeds

## Key Features

**Shielding**: Blocks electromagnetic interference from power cables and other sources

**Pinouts**: Standardized wiring patterns (TIA/EIA 568A or 568B) ensure consistent signal routing

**Gold-plated contacts**: Prevent corrosion and improve connection quality

## Purpose

RJ45 connectors enable physical network connections between devices like computers, routers, switches, and printers. Without them, wired networking wouldn't be possible.
